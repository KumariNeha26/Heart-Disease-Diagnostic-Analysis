# Heart-Disease-Diagnostic-Analysis
The goal is to perform an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process on a heart disease diagnostic dataset, followed by an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The dataset includes various attributes such as heart disease prevalence by gender, age, and other medical factors.

Project Steps: ETL: Load, clean, and preprocess heart disease data for analysis. EDA: Analyze heart disease rates by age, gender, and other factors; find key correlations. Dashboard: Create visualizations (charts, graphs) to show metrics like disease rates by demographic factors. Insights: Identify key risk factors and summarize findings for future healthÂ preparation.
