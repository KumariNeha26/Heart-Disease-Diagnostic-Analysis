Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis

Project Overview
This project focuses on processing and analyzing heart disease diagnostic data using ETL and EDA techniques. The dataset includes patient attributes such as age, gender, and medical factors to assess heart disease prevalence.

Key Steps
ETL Process: Load, clean, and preprocess data for analysis.
EDA: Identify patterns and correlations in heart disease occurrence.
Visualization: Develop charts and graphs to highlight key insights.
Findings: Identify risk factors and summarize results for better health analysis.

This analysis supports data-driven decision-making in healthcare by uncovering critical risk patterns.
