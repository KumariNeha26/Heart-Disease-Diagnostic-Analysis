# Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis

This project applies ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a heart disease diagnostic dataset to identify risk factors and patterns affecting heart disease prevalence.

Project Steps
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):
Load and clean the dataset.
Preprocess data (handle missing values, normalize, and encode categorical variables).
      
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze heart disease rates based on age, gender, and other medical attributes.
Identify key correlations and patterns.
   
Data Visualization:
Create charts and graphs to illustrate disease rates and demographic factors.

Insights & Conclusion:
Identify major risk factors influencing heart disease.
Summarize findings for potential preventive healthcare strategies.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Conclusion
This project provides data-driven insights into heart disease prevalence by analyzing demographic and medical attributes, helping in early diagnosis and preventive measures.
